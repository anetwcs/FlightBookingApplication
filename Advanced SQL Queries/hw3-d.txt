This is my first time working with a cloud-hosted DBMS.
 
In my experience, The DBMS provided by Microsoft's Azure was quite user-friendly compared to a terminal's user iterface.
I mostly used the Query Editor and personally like
the result and message section on the interface. The side tab to view the files and folders are 
also convenient compared to using a terminal. In terms of execution time for SQL Databases. I thought 
it was quite slow to run a few queries at first. But after reading Patrick's Ed post about adjusting the
DTUs to increase the run time, I know how to work around that part now. 

I would have to use DBMS from other cloud-computing services to give the right recommendation. 
Compared to DBMS that are not cloud-based, cloud-hosted DBMS provides the flexibility to work on 
one data base from different computers or by different people. Those are what I would recommend 
to users who need to work on larger dataset or require collaboration. For users who only need to
learn about DBMS or work on a small dataset. I would recommend using the local terminal to avoid 
service charges from Azure.
